- **Bulk Operations**: Calendar and list views for efficient schedule management

### 👥 Staff Assignment
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Intuitive assignment using react-big-calendar
- **Role Compatibility**: Automatic filtering of users based on shift requirements
- **Multiple Assignments**: Support for multiple staff per shift if needed
- **Assignment Status Tracking**: Scheduled → Confirmed → Completed workflow

### 🔄 Shift Swaps
- **Peer-to-Peer Requests**: Staff can request shift swaps with colleagues
- **Approval Workflow**: Target users can approve/deny swap requests
- **Automatic Assignment Transfer**: Seamless shift ownership transfer upon approval
- **Message System**: Optional messages with swap requests for context

### 🏖️ Time Off Management
- **Request Submission**: Staff can submit time off requests with date ranges
- **Manager Review**: Dedicated interface for managers to approve/deny requests
- **Conflict Detection**: Visual indicators for scheduling conflicts

- **Socket.io Integration**: Reliable WebSocket communication

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Core scheduling tables
shifts (id, date, start_time, end_time, role_required, location, notes)
user_shifts (id, user_id, shift_id, status, assigned_at, assigned_by)
shift_swaps (id, requesting_user_id, target_user_id, shift_id, status, message)
time_off_requests (id, user_id, start_date, end_date, reason, status)
```

### API Endpoints
- **GET** `/api/schedules` - Fetch shifts with filtering options
- **POST** `/api/schedules` - Create new shifts (managers only)
- **POST** `/api/schedules/:id/assign` - Assign users to shifts
- **PUT** `/api/schedules/assignments/:id/status` - Update assignment status
- **GET/POST** `/api/schedules/swap-requests` - Manage shift swap requests
- **GET/POST** `/api/schedules/time-off` - Handle time off requests

### Socket Events
- `new-schedule` - Broadcast shift creation
- `shift-assignment` - Notify assignment changes
- `shift-status-update` - Live status updates
- `shift-swap-completed` - Successful swap notifications
- `time-off-request` - New time off requests
- `time-off-response` - Approval/denial responses

## 🎨 User Interface Components

### SchedulePlanner (Main Component)

## 👥 Role-Based Access Control

### Managers & Owners
- ✅ Create and edit all shifts
- ✅ Assign any user to any shift
- ✅ View all schedules and assignments
- ✅ Approve/deny time off requests
- ✅ Manage shift swap requests
- ✅ Access administrative controls

### All Staff Members
- ✅ View personal schedule
- ✅ Confirm/cancel own assignments
- ✅ Request shift swaps with colleagues
- ✅ Submit time off requests
- ✅ Receive real-time notifications
- ❌ Cannot create or edit shifts

### Automatic Permissions
- **Role Compatibility**: Servers can cover host/bartender shifts
- **Self-Management**: Staff can only modify their own assignments
- **Notification Targeting**: Users only see relevant notifications
- **Data Filtering**: API responses filtered by user permissions

## 🔄 Real-Time Synchronization

### Live Updates
All changes propagate instantly across all connected devices:
- New shift creation appears immediately
- Assignment changes update all views
- Status updates reflect in real-time
- Swap completions trigger immediate notifications

### Socket.io Implementation
```javascript
// Server-side event emission
req.app.get('io').emit('new-schedule', newShift)
req.app.get('io').to(`user_${userId}`).emit('swap-request', data)

// Client-side event handling
socket.on('new-schedule', handleNewSchedule)
socket.on('shift-assignment', handleShiftAssignment)
```

## 🎯 User Experience Flow

### Manager Creating a Shift
1. Navigate to `/schedule` from dashboard
2. Click "Create Shift" button
3. Fill out shift details (date, time, role, location)
4. Submit form → Shift appears in calendar immediately
5. All connected users see new shift via real-time update

### Staff Viewing Schedule
1. Access schedule from dashboard link
2. See personal assignments highlighted
3. Filter by date range or view calendar/list
4. Confirm shifts or request swaps as needed
5. Receive notifications for relevant updates

### Shift Swap Process
1. Staff member clicks "Request Swap" on assigned shift
2. Select target colleague and add optional message
3. Target user receives notification instantly
4. Target user approves/denies via notification or panel
5. Upon approval, shift ownership transfers automatically

## 📱 Frontend Integration

### Navigation
- **Dashboard Link**: "Schedule Planner" button in management section
- **Direct Route**: `/schedule` accessible to all authenticated users
- **Mobile Responsive**: Optimized for all device sizes
