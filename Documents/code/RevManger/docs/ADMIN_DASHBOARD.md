## Data Calculations

### Revenue Metrics
```sql
-- Today's revenue with percentage change
WITH today_revenue AS (
  SELECT SUM(total_amount + COALESCE(tip_amount, 0)) as today_total
  FROM orders 
  WHERE DATE(created_at) = CURRENT_DATE 
  AND status = 'completed'
),
week_revenue AS (
  SELECT AVG(daily_total) as daily_avg
  FROM (
    SELECT SUM(total_amount + COALESCE(tip_amount, 0)) as daily_total
    FROM orders 
    WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
    AND status = 'completed'
    GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
  ) daily_sales
)
SELECT 
  today_total,
  ROUND(((today_total - daily_avg) / daily_avg) * 100, 2) as change_percent
FROM today_revenue, week_revenue
```

### Table Turnover Rate
```sql
-- Orders per table calculation
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT table_number) as active_tables,
  COUNT(*) as total_orders,
  ROUND(COUNT(*)::numeric / COUNT(DISTINCT table_number), 2) as turnover_rate
FROM orders 
WHERE DATE(created_at) = CURRENT_DATE
AND table_number IS NOT NULL
```

### Labor Cost Analysis
```sql
-- Estimated labor cost vs revenue
SELECT 
  SUM(hours_worked) * 15 as estimated_labor_cost, -- $15/hour average
  (SELECT SUM(total_amount) FROM orders WHERE DATE(created_at) = CURRENT_DATE) as revenue,
  ROUND((SUM(hours_worked) * 15 / revenue) * 100, 2) as labor_cost_percentage
FROM shifts 
WHERE DATE(start_time) = CURRENT_DATE
```

SELECT * FROM orders 
WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Verify staff shifts for labor analysis
SELECT u.first_name, u.last_name, s.* 
FROM shifts s
JOIN users u ON s.user_id = u.id
WHERE s.start_time >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days';

-- Check user roles and permissions
SELECT id, email, first_name, last_name, role, is_active 
FROM users 
WHERE role IN ('manager', 'owner');
```
