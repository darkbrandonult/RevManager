# Real-Time Kitchen Order Queue - Implementation Guide

## 🎯 Overview

The Real-Time Kitchen Order Queue system has been successfully implemented with comprehensive Socket.io integration, providing instant updates across all connected clients. This system enables seamless communication between front-of-house, kitchen staff, and management.

## 🔧 Backend Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

### 1. Enhanced Orders API (`/server/routes/orders.js`)

#### New/Enhanced Endpoints:
- **GET `/api/orders/kitchen`** - Kitchen-specific order view with full item details
- **GET `/api/orders/kitchen/summary`** - Real-time statistics for kitchen dashboard
- **POST `/api/orders`** - Create orders with Socket.io broadcasting
- **PUT `/api/orders/:id/status`** - Update order status with real-time notifications
- **DELETE `/api/orders/:id`** - Cancel orders with live updates

#### Socket.io Events Implemented:
```javascript
// New order placed
io.emit('new-order', {
  id: 123,
  customer_name: "John Doe",
  status: "pending",
  total_amount: 45.99,
  items: [...],
  created_at: "2024-01-15T14:30:00Z"
})

// Order status updated
io.emit('order-status-update', {
  orderId: 123,
  status: "preparing",
  updatedBy: 5,
  updatedByName: "Chef Mike",
  timestamp: "2024-01-15T14:35:00Z",
  estimatedCompletion: "2024-01-15T15:00:00Z"
})

// Order cancelled
io.emit('order-cancelled', {
  orderId: 123,
  reason: "Customer request",
  timestamp: "2024-01-15T14:33:00Z"
})
```

### 2. Database Schema Updates

#### Enhanced Orders Table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending',
  total_amount NUMERIC(10,2) NOT NULL,
  created_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  estimated_completion TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### New Order Items Table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE order_items (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id INTEGER REFERENCES orders(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  menu_item_id INTEGER REFERENCES menu_items(id),
  quantity INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
  price NUMERIC(10,2) NOT NULL,
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## 📱 Frontend Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

### 1. KitchenQueue Component (`/src/components/KitchenQueue.tsx`)

**Features:**
- ✅ Real-time order updates without page refresh
- ✅ Three-column layout: Pending → Preparing → Ready
- ✅ Priority indicators for urgent orders (30+ minutes old)
- ✅ Status update buttons with loading states
- ✅ Estimated completion time tracking
- ✅ Order item details with special notes
- ✅ Push notifications for new orders
- ✅ Socket.io event handling for live updates

**Status Workflow:**
1. **Pending Orders** → Click "🍳 Start Preparing" → Moves to Preparing
2. **Preparing Orders** → Click "✅ Mark Ready" → Moves to Ready
3. **Ready Orders** → Click "📦 Complete" → Completes order

### 2. KitchenDashboard Component (`/src/components/KitchenDashboard.tsx`)

**Features:**
- ✅ Real-time summary statistics (pending, preparing, ready, completed)
- ✅ Live activity feed showing order updates
- ✅ Revenue tracking and performance metrics
- ✅ Quick action buttons for navigation
- ✅ Socket.io integration for instant updates

## 🧪 Testing the Real-Time System

### Test Scenario 1: New Order Workflow
```bash
# 1. Open Kitchen Queue in multiple browser windows
# Window 1: http://localhost:5173/kitchen/queue (as chef/cook)
# Window 2: http://localhost:5173/kitchen/dashboard (as kitchen staff)

# 2. Create a new order via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/orders \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "customer_name": "Jane Smith",
    "total_amount": 32.50,
    "items": [
      {
        "menu_item_id": 1,
        "quantity": 2,
        "price": 18.99
      },
      {
        "menu_item_id": 3,
        "quantity": 1,
        "price": 13.50
      }
    ]
  }'

# 3. Observe real-time updates:
# ✅ Order appears instantly in all open kitchen windows
# ✅ Dashboard statistics update automatically
# ✅ Activity feed shows new order notification
# ✅ Push notification appears (if enabled)
```

### Test Scenario 2: Status Update Workflow
```bash
# 1. With order visible in kitchen queue
# 2. Click "🍳 Start Preparing" button
# 3. Observe real-time updates:

# Backend API call:
PUT /api/orders/123/status
{
  "status": "preparing",
  "estimated_completion": "2024-01-15T15:30:00Z"
}

# Socket.io broadcast:
{
  "orderId": 123,
  "status": "preparing",
  "updatedBy": 5,
  "updatedByName": "Chef Mike",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:35:00Z"
}

# Frontend updates:
# ✅ Order moves from Pending to Preparing column
# ✅ Status indicators update across all windows
# ✅ Dashboard statistics refresh instantly
# ✅ Activity feed shows status change
```

### Test Scenario 3: Multi-Device Synchronization
```bash
# 1. Open kitchen queue on multiple devices:
#    - iPad in kitchen
#    - Phone for expediter
#    - Desktop for manager

# 2. Make status changes on any device
# 3. Watch instant synchronization:
# ✅ All devices update simultaneously
# ✅ No page refresh required
# ✅ Real-time statistics stay synchronized
# ✅ Activity feeds show same updates
```

## 🚀 Production Deployment Features

- ✅ JWT authentication for all API endpoints
- ✅ Audit logging for all order status changes
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization

### Performance & Scalability

## 📊 Real-Time Event Flow

### Complete Order Lifecycle:
```
1. Order Created → 'new-order' event → Kitchen Queue updates
2. Start Preparing → 'order-status-update' event → All clients sync
3. Mark Ready → 'order-status-update' event → Server dashboards update
4. Complete Order → 'order-status-update' event + inventory deduction
5. Order Cancelled → 'order-cancelled' event → Remove from all queues
```

### Socket.io Architecture:
```javascript
// Server-side event emission
io.emit('new-order', orderData)           // Broadcast to all clients
io.emit('order-status-update', updateData) // Status changes
io.emit('order-cancelled', cancelData)     // Cancellations

// Client-side event handling
socket.on('new-order', handleNewOrder)
socket.on('order-status-update', handleStatusUpdate)  
socket.on('order-cancelled', handleOrderCancelled)
```
